# MOC — Matrix Ontology Catalog
**Acronym:** MOC  
**Status:** Stable  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-25  

> 🚨 **IMPORTANT WARNING**: This document contains ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES (such as `technical`, `business`, `draft`, etc.) that are NOT mandatory taxonomies. Each organization defines its own hierarchies according to their specific needs. Examples serve only as conceptual reference.

> "Local flexibility preserves global coherence."

## 1. Introduction

The **Matrix Ontology Catalog (MOC)** is the fundamental component that allows the Matrix Protocol to separate universal core concepts from organization-specific taxonomies and structures.

MOC defines **configurable hierarchies** for any concept that depends on organizational structures, maintaining global conceptual consistency while enabling total local adaptability.

MOC serves as the governance and configuration system that allows different organizations to adapt the Matrix Protocol to their specific structures without losing conceptual interoperability.

---

## 2. Terms and Definitions

- **Core Concepts**: Universal fixed elements of the protocol (scope, domain, maturity)
- **Local Taxonomies**: Organization-specific hierarchical structures defined by each organization
- **Configurable Hierarchies**: Classification systems adaptable to organizational needs
- **MOC Nodes**: Individual elements within a hierarchy (e.g., "team", "technical", "draft")
- **Organizational Governance**: Specific rules for authority, visibility, and propagation

Cross-reference to **organizational MOC** for specific ontological definitions.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Fundamental Conceptual Separation

**Core Concepts (Universal)**
- Fixed and immutable across all implementations
- Examples: scope, domain, maturity, propagation, workflow checkpoints
- Defined by the Matrix Protocol

**Local Taxonomies (Configurable)**
- Defined by the implementer in the MOC
- Examples: specific scope names, domain structure, organizational roles
- Adaptable to organizational context

### Configurable Semantic Hierarchies

Every hierarchical concept MUST:
- Be conceptually defined by the protocol
- Have its concrete hierarchy provided by the MOC
- Allow reorganization without breaking MEF, ZOF, or OIF
- Maintain stable semantic relationships

### Local Flexibility Principle
MOC ensures that organization-specific structures do not conflict with the protocol's conceptual interoperability, enabling total adaptation while maintaining global coherence.

## 4. Normative Rules

> ⚠️ This section is **normative**.

### Mandatory MOC Structure
Every organizational MOC MUST contain:
1. **Version metadata**: version, organization, creation/modification dates
2. **Minimum hierarchies**: scope, domain, maturity, evaluation_criteria
3. **Governance rules**: version control, audit, conflict resolution
4. **Nodes with complete metadata**: id, label, parent, level, governance

### Required Hierarchies
- **scope**: MUST define knowledge reach and visibility
- **domain**: MUST define knowledge areas and specialization  
- **maturity**: MUST define validation and reliability levels
- **evaluation_criteria**: MUST define criteria for EvaluateForEnrich checkpoint

### Integrity Rules
- Nodes MUST have unique identifiers within each hierarchy
- Parent-child relationships MUST be consistent
- Hierarchical levels MUST be sequential (0, 1, 2...)
- Governance rules MUST be defined for all nodes

### Change Control Rules
- MOC alterations MUST be versioned
- Impact on dependent UKIs MUST be analyzed
- Approval by competent authority MUST be mandatory
- Automatic notifications MUST be sent to affected parties

### 🔐 Authority Validation Service (Normative)

The **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** provides the canonical reference for **authority validation** in the Matrix Protocol.  
This service does not execute orchestration or decision-making (ZOF, OIF roles), but defines the **rules and ontology** required to validate whether a user MAY perform a given operation.

#### Service Interface
- **Input parameters**:  
  - `user_moc_context` (hierarchical claims: scope, domain, authority levels)  
  - `operation` (read, enrich, promote, create, update, delete)  
  - `scope_ref` (target knowledge scope)  
  - `domain_ref` (target knowledge domain)  
  - `type_ref` (target knowledge type: rule, procedure, policy, etc.)  
  - `maturity_ref` (target knowledge maturity level)  

- **Output**:  
  - `authorized: true|false` (authorization result)  
  - `required_authority` (node or level expected for authorization)  
  - `escalation_hint` (possible higher authority node for delegation/override)  
  - `moc_nodes_cited` (specific MOC nodes used in validation decision)

#### Framework Integration Requirements
- The **ZOF** MUST consume this service before enrichment (EvaluateForEnrich checkpoint)  
- The **OIF** MUST explain validation decisions to users, citing relevant MOC nodes  
- The **MEF** MUST validate UKI creation authority via this service before persisting knowledge

---

## 5. Interoperability

MOC serves as the governance foundation that enables organizational customization across all frameworks:

- **MEF (Matrix Embedding Framework)**: Validates all *_ref field references against MOC hierarchies; enforces organizational taxonomy constraints; provides governance rules for UKI creation and promotion workflows
- **ZOF (Zion Orchestration Framework)**: Supplies evaluation criteria for EvaluateForEnrich checkpoint; validates user authority for enrichment operations; defines organizational workflow governance rules
- **OIF (Operator Intelligence Framework)**: Provides hierarchical context for intelligence filtering; validates user authority for archetype operations; supplies escalation paths for authority requirements
- **MEP (Matrix Epistemic Principle)**: Implements organizational context for derived authority; provides taxonomic foundation for epistemological stratification; enables local flexibility with global coherence

See [Matrix Protocol Integration Diagram](MATRIX_PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_DIAGRAM.md) for MOC validation and governance flows.

## 6. Conventions and Examples

All examples in this document are **illustrative only** and do not define normative behavior.  
Normative semantics (scopes, governance, archetypes, enrich criteria) are always derived from the **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** of each organization.  
Examples are provided for clarity and MAY be adapted to local contexts, but MUST NOT be treated as protocol-level obligations.

### **MEF Integration**
```yaml
# --- Illustrative Example ---
# MOC Fields in MEF:
scope_ref: "team"           # Reference to MOC node
scope_mode: "restricted"    # or "propagated"
domain_ref: "technical"     # Reference to MOC node
type_ref: "pattern"         # Reference to MOC node
maturity_ref: "approved"    # Reference to MOC node

# Automatic Resolution:
# - System consults MOC to validate references
# - Applies governance rules automatically
# - Propagates changes according to configuration
```

### **ZOF Integration**
```yaml
# --- Illustrative Example ---
# EvaluateForEnrich Checkpoint:
flow_execution:
  - state: "evaluate_for_enrich"
    signals:
      context: "Evaluating if generated knowledge should enrich Oracle"
      criteria_refs: ["relevance", "reusability", "impact"]  # MOC references
      decision: "Based on organization-specific MOC criteria"
      result: "Approved for enrichment with 'team' scope"
```

### **OIF Integration**
```yaml
# --- Illustrative Example ---
# Access Control:
user_context:
  scope_level: "team" 
  domain_access: ["technical", "business"]
  
access_control:
  uki_filtering: "based on user's scope_ref and domain_ref"
  explanation_refs: "references specific MOC nodes in justifications"
```

### **Change Control Process**
```yaml
# --- Illustrative Example ---
change_process:
  impact_analysis:
    - node_addition: "Low impact, backward compatible"
    - hierarchy_modification: "Medium impact, validation required"
    - node_removal: "High impact, mandatory dependency analysis"
  
  update_process:
    1: "Change proposal with impact analysis"
    2: "Dependent UKI validation"
    3: "Approval by competent authority"
    4: "Versioning and notification"
    5: "Migration period for dependents"
```

**Benefits Examples:**
- *Total Flexibility*: Adapt structures to specific organizational needs
- *Transparent Governance*: Clear and auditable rules for changes
- *Organic Evolution*: Organizational changes don't break the protocol
- *Interoperability*: Different organizations can share knowledge
- *Rich AI Context*: AI understands specific organizational hierarchies
